# TeamViewer-PS-Module
This One Is Pretty Self Explanatory
All Was based on teamviewer JSON API

I'm in the process of Building the Module so More Funcitons will come and I plan to do a UI based on this after.
But For Now Based on this You could also do pretty much anything
The link to the Doc im using:

Most important Thing is to have a Teamviewer Enteprise Token.
It's Called an App Token or a Script Token by Teamviewer BTW.

Here is a link How to generate it.
